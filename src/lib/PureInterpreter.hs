Interpreter functions for while programs. These functions are essentially
Haskell encodings of the semantic rules for the while language given in Neil

-- While stores are maps from variable names to trees, i.e. the values of
-- variables
type Store = M.Map Name ETree

-- To evaluate a program, we evaluate the program's command with the initial
-- store that contains the read variable with the value of the input, and
-- output (or 'write') the value of the write-variable in the resulting store.
evalProg :: Expression -> Program -> ETree
evalProg input (Program rd comm wrt) = M.findWithDefault ENil wrt store
    where store = evalComm (evalComm M.empty (Assign rd input)) comm

-- Commands update the contents of the store:
--   Assignments update the assignee variable with the assigned value.
--   While loops evaluate a guard expression with an initial store. If the
--     resulting expression is nil, we do nothing. Otherwise, we update the
--     store by executing the while loop's command, and repeat the process with
--     the new store.
--   Sequential Composition is evaluated by first evaluating command one with an
--     initial store, and then evaluating command two with the resulting store.
--   Conditionals are evaluated by first evaluating the condition. If the
--     condition is false (nil), the 'else-block' is evaluated. Otherwise the
--     'then-block' is evaluated.
