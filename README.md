HWhile is an interpreter for the While language written in Haskell.

See 'example.while' for a simple example.

SYNTAX
The parser uses a grammar identical to that in the lecture slides, with four
exceptions:
 - An infix constructor: You can write 'a . b' as well as 'cons a b', if you
   prefer
 - Brackets can be used to enforce a particular association
 - The grammar in the lecture slides requires us to write a variable at the end
   of our programs. The parser's grammar allows us to put an expression here, as
   well as a variable. This makes constant functions easier to write, e.g:
       read X; Y := nil . nil; write Y
   can be written as
       read X; ; write nil . nil
 - Integer literals can be used - the parser will convert them into the
   appropriate tree before execution
The lexer also provides us with some nice things:
 - A '#' will tell the lexer to ignore the rest of the line, e.g. write a
   comment
 - the head & tail functions can be written fully ('head' or 'tail') or in the
   abbreviated fashion ('hd' and 'tl').
