HWhile is an interpreter for the While language written in Haskell.

See 'example.while' for a simple example.

SYNTAX

The parser uses a grammar identical to that in the lecture slides, with four
exceptions:
 - An infix constructor: You can write 'a . b' as well as 'cons a b', if you
   prefer
 - Brackets can be used to enforce a particular association
 - The grammar in the lecture slides requires us to write a variable at the end
   of our programs. The parser's grammar allows us to put an expression here, as
   well as a variable. This makes it possible to write constant functions, or
   functions that modify the returned value at the end of the program, easier to
   write, e.g:

       read X; Y := nil . nil; write Y

   can be written as

       read X; X := X; write nil . nil

 - Integer literals can be used - the parser will convert them into the
   appropriate tree before execution

The lexer also provides us with some nice things:
 - A '#' will tell the lexer to ignore the rest of the line, e.g. write a
   comment
 - the head & tail functions can be written fully ('head' or 'tail') or in the
   abbreviated fashion ('hd' and 'tl')

SEMANTICS

The semantics of this implementation match exactly those specified in the
lecture slides.
